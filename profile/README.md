## Reallabor Wald / Living the Forest Lab

![banner with logo of burning match and text: Living the Forest Lab is a research project that brings together electrical engineering and design to explore transdisciplinary, experimental ways of creating prototypes for forest protection with feminist perspectives.](docs/lifo_banner.png)

“Living the Forest Lab” is a research initiative funded by the Stiftung Innovation in der Hochschullehre, located at TU Berlin’s Faculty IV Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Communications Systems.

This project aims to promote transdisciplinary teaching through experimental and open-ended projects that develop prototype solutions for forest protection. By bridging open-source, maker, and open hardware communities with students, labs, experts, and the public, the project addresses the ecological, social, and economic functions of forests. Recognizing the critical role forests play in biodiversity and climate regulation, the project emphasizes the importance of forest protection in mitigating climate change and preserving ecosystems. By using a living lab approach, the project integrates scientific research with real-world applications to tackle wicked problems on a local scale, encouraging communities to exchange knowledge and develop prototypes together.
